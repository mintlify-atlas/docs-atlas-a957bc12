## Why Motion?

Motion is designed to make animation simple without sacrificing power or performance. Whether you're building interactive UI components, complex page transitions, or scroll-driven experiences, Motion provides the tools you need.

### Built for developers

Motion's API is designed to feel natural in your framework of choice. Animate with a single prop in React, or use the `animate()` function in vanilla JavaScript. The library handles the complexity of animation timing, interruption, and hardware acceleration for you.

### Optimized for performance

Motion's hybrid animation engine automatically uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) for hardware-accelerated animations when possible, falling back to JavaScript animations when needed. This ensures smooth 60fps+ animations even on lower-end devices.

### Framework support

Motion provides dedicated packages for the most popular frameworks:

  <Tab title="React">
    ```jsx
    import { motion } from "motion/react"

    function Component() {
        return <motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    import { animate } from "motion"

    animate("#box", { x: 100 })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Vue">
    ```vue
    <script>
        import { motion } from "motion-v"
    </script>

    <template>
        <motion.div :animate="{ x: 100 }" />
    </template>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Features

### Gestures

Built-in support for drag, hover, tap, and pan gestures with configurable constraints and momentum.

### Spring physics

Realistic spring animations with full control over stiffness, damping, and mass parameters.

### Layout animations

Animate changes to your layout automatically, even when elements change size or position in the DOM.

### Scroll effects

Link animations to scroll position for parallax effects, progress indicators, and scroll-triggered animations.

### Keyframe animations

Define complex multi-step animations with full control over timing and easing.

### Variants

Orchestrate animations across multiple components with reusable animation definitions.
