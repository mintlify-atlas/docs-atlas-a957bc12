Motion provides a powerful React integration that makes it easy to create fluid animations and interactions in your React applications.

## Installation

Install Motion via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install motion
```

```bash
yarn add motion
```

## Quick Start

Motion exports everything from `framer-motion`, providing both `motion` and `m` components:

```jsx
import { motion } from "motion"

function App() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 1 }}
    >
      Hello World
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Motion Components

Motion wraps standard HTML and SVG elements with animation capabilities. Any HTML or SVG element can be animated by prefixing it with `motion.`:

```jsx
<motion.div />
<motion.button />
<motion.svg />
<motion.path />
```

### Animation Props

Motion components accept several props to control animations:

- `initial` - Starting state for animations
- `animate` - Target state for animations
- `exit` - State when component is removed (requires `AnimatePresence`)
- `transition` - Configuration for the animation
- `style` - Enhanced style prop supporting `MotionValue`s

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ x: -100, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: "easeOut" }}
/>
```

### Gesture Animations

Motion provides declarative gesture handlers:

```jsx
<motion.button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
  whileFocus={{ outline: "2px solid blue" }}
>
  Click me
</motion.button>
```

## The `m` Component

For bundle size optimization, Motion also exports a minimal `m` component with the same API:

```jsx
import { m } from "motion"

function App() {
  return <m.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
}
```

## Package Structure

Motion is a re-export of `framer-motion`, which is part of a larger monorepo:

- **`motion`** - Main package, re-exports everything from `framer-motion`
- **`framer-motion`** - React-specific animation code
- **`motion-dom`** - Vanilla JavaScript animation library
- **`motion-utils`** - Pure functions and easing utilities

## TypeScript Support

Motion is written in TypeScript and provides full type definitions:

```tsx
import { motion, MotionProps } from "motion"
import { FC } from "react"

const AnimatedCard: FC<MotionProps> = (props) => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Motion Components](/react/motion-components) and available elements
- Explore [AnimatePresence](/react/animate-presence) for exit animations
- Discover [Layout Animations](/react/layout-animations) for shared element transitions
- Master [React Hooks](/react/hooks) for advanced animation control

## Performance

Motion is highly optimized for performance:

- Uses GPU-accelerated transforms when possible
- Batches reads and writes to prevent layout thrashing
- Supports reduced motion preferences
- Provides tools like `LazyMotion` for code splitting

```jsx
import { LazyMotion, domAnimation, m } from "motion"

function App() {
  return (
    <LazyMotion features={domAnimation">
      <m.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />
    </LazyMotion>
  )
}
```
