title: useReducedMotion()
description: React hook that returns whether the user prefers reduced motion
---

## Overview

The `useReducedMotion()` hook returns a boolean indicating whether the user has enabled reduced motion preferences on their device. This allows you to create accessible animations that respect user preferences for motion.

## Import

```jsx
import { useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"

function Component() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()
  
  return (
    <motion.div
      animate={{
        x: shouldReduceMotion ? 0 : 100,
        opacity: 1
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Return Value

<ResponseField name="shouldReduceMotion" type="boolean">
  Returns `true` if the user has enabled reduced motion in their system preferences, `false` otherwise.
</ResponseField>

## Examples

### Conditional Animation Type

Replace motion-intensive animations with simpler alternatives:

```jsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"

function Sidebar({ isOpen }) {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()
  const closedX = shouldReduceMotion ? 0 : "-100%"
  
  return (
    <motion.div
      animate={{
        opacity: isOpen ? 1 : 0,
        x: isOpen ? 0 : closedX
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### Disable Autoplay

Disable autoplay features that might cause motion sickness:

```jsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"

function VideoBackground() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()
  
  return (
    <video
      autoPlay={!shouldReduceMotion}
      loop={!shouldReduceMotion}
      muted
    >
      <source src="background.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  )
}
```

### Adjust Animation Duration

Reduce animation duration for users with motion sensitivity:

```jsx
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react"

function Card() {
  const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()
  
  return (
    <motion.div
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
      transition={{
        duration: shouldReduceMotion ? 0 : 0.3
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Behavior

- The hook reads the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` media query preference
- Returns `true` when the media query matches `reduce`
- Returns `false` when the media query matches `no-preference`
- Initializes lazily on first use for optimal performance
- Currently returns the initial state and does not respond to live changes

## Accessibility

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Replace movement animations">
    For users with motion sensitivity, replace `x`, `y`, `rotate`, and `scale` animations with `opacity` fades or instant state changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maintain functional clarity">
    Even with reduced motion, ensure that state changes are still visually clear. Use opacity, color changes, or other non-motion cues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test with system settings">
    Enable "Reduce Motion" in your OS accessibility settings to test the user experience:
    - **macOS**: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
    - **iOS**: Settings → Accessibility → Motion → Reduce Motion
    - **Windows**: Settings → Ease of Access → Display → Show animations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
